  - [x] Listen to audio output (e.g. speaker)
  - [x] Chunk audio stream after silence (max 30 seconds)
  - [x] Transcribe audio chunk and append to textfile

## Phase 3: Streamlit Interface
- [x] 3.1 Main Application
  - [x] Create main.py with basic layout
  - [x] Implement session state management

  - [x] Create loading indicators

- [x] 3.2 Recording Interface
  - [x] Add recording control buttons
  - [x] Create real-time transcript display
  - [x] Implement meeting status indicator
  - [x] Add basic meeting metadata form

- [x] 3.3 Analysis Interface
  - [x] Create analysis trigger buttons:
    - [x] Generate Minutes
    - [x] Extract Tasks
    - [x] Identify Decisions
  - [x] Add analysis results display
  - [x] Implement export options (copy to clipboard, download as markdown)
  - [x] Create command button to give the agents a custom task via text-input or microphone

## Phase 4: Voice Response Integration
- [x] 4.1 F5-TTS Setup
  - [x] Install and configure F5-TTS locally
  - [x] Add voice config with reference audio/text to offer different voices
  - [x] Create VoiceGenerator class
  - [x] Implement response generation
  - [x] Add audio playback controls (e.g. read the response a task)

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- [x] 5.1 Core Testing
  - [x] Add unit tests for:
    - [x] Audio recording
    - [x] Whisper transcription
    - [x] File management
    - [x] LLM integration
  - [x] Create test data fixtures
  - [x] Add integration tests
  - [x] Implement performance tests

- [x] 5.2 Documentation
  - [x] Update README.md with setup instructions
  - [x] Create user guide with examples
  - [x] Add API documentation
  - [x] Document configuration options

## Notes
- Focus on local execution for Whisper and F5-TTS
- Store transcripts as plain text files
- Keep metadata and analysis results in JSON
- Implement proper error handling throughout
- Add logging for debugging

## Dependencies Between Tasks
- Audio recording must be completed before Whisper integration
- File management system needed before LLM integration
- Basic UI needed before implementing analysis features
- Testing should be done in parallel with development

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor Whisper CPU/GPU usage
- Implement efficient file handling
- Cache LLM responses where appropriate
- Optimize audio buffer sizes

## Project Status: COMPLETED ✓
All planned features and tasks have been successfully implemented, tested, and documented.
